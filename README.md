## Tokyo Night
Fresh dots comin' soon. This time, I'll write documentations for real (jk)

### Early sneak peek
Things are prone to be changed :)

### What do we have in this repo? (For now)

- **GTK/Qt theme:** Materia-dark-compact gtk and kvantum theme, but with Tokyonight colorscheme, cause I don't like the Tokyonight gtk theme out there
- **Xfwm theme:** An Xfwm theme shamelessly stolen from https://github.com/ahmadhabibi14/dotfile (thanks to ahmadhabibi for his work), with borders added by me
- **Icon theme:** A modified Zafiro icon theme (with Tokyonight colored folders and symbolic icons), Fluent, and I don't actually even remember
- **Skippy-XD config:** Skippy-XD is similar to the expose-thing from MacOS. I use this cause the regular alt-tab is so boring
- **~/.Xresources** config
- **Rofi** config, although I use it for rofi-emoji. I use Findex as application launcher
- And some misc stuffs I don't remember about

### What will we have ~~in the upcoming days~~ after my exam and depression ends?

- Eww widgets (User dashboard, system dashboard, calendar widget and logout screen)
- A nice little startpage
- gtk.css for different stuffs
- And some more, idk. I should get psychological treatment
